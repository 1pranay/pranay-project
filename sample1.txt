Virtualization as a Solution:
Resource Utilization Issue:

Traditional server configurations often led to resource wastage.
Example: A server with 100 GB RAM and 100 CPUs, but an application only needs 1 GB RAM and 1 CPU, resulting in significant waste.
Introduction of Virtualization:

Virtualization addressed resource inefficiencies.
Definition: Virtualization involves creating virtual servers on a physical server.
Multiple virtual servers can run on a single physical server, each dedicated to a specific application.
Benefits of Virtualization:

Optimized Resource Usage: Efficiently use server resources, reducing costs.
Cost Savings: Instead of buying multiple servers, invest in one with higher configuration.
Scalability: Easily scale by creating more virtual servers as needed.
Isolation: Each application runs in its own virtual environment, minimizing interference.
Private Cloud Concept:

Definition: Private cloud refers to cloud resources confined within an organization.
Characteristics:
Access is limited to the organization's internal use.
Managed and maintained by the organization's own system administrators.
Cloud Computing:
Definition: Cloud computing allows on-demand access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources over the internet.
